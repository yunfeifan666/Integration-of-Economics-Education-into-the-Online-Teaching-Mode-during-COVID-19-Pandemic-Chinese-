The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 has led universities to turn to the online teaching. This change not only provides the opportunity to master the online teaching process, but also challenges the reform of the traditional teaching mode.

In online teaching, students enjoy the opportunity of multi-channel learning and can integrate knowledge independently. Through online resources, students can expand the learning boundary, improve the learning efficiency, and cultivate the ability of independent learning. In addition, in the professional education of economics, with the help of online teaching, combined with practical cases and practical applications, it can more vividly convey the principles of economics and promote students' understanding of knowledge.

Patriotism education has also become a part of online teaching. By optimizing course design and integrating online resources, teachers can guide students to establish correct ideas and strengthen patriotic feelings. Practical courses and innovative activities provide a platform for students to practice and apply economic knowledge, and at the same time promote students' understanding and concern for national development.

In the information age, educators need to integrate online resources and establish a suitable online course platform to ensure the dissemination of correct ideology. At the same time, the application of new media also provides a new way for ideological education and enhances the appeal of ideological and political courses.

In general, under the online teaching, the organic integration of economics education with the online not only expands the teaching method, but also provides more possibilities for students' comprehensive quality and national identity.
